Hi Team,
#Letest #project #related #interview #questions #answers 2 + #experience  2022
Q.What are the collections you have used in project?
Sol : In our project, we have used List and Map
Map : To invoke the stored procedure using spring JDBC. Here executes() method will expect argument
input and output as map.
Can you write snippet code how you implement in the project?
How to insert and retrieve the values in Map?
How HashMap internally will work?
List : From the enroll DB we will get the list mobile numbers and card details .
To handle this, we are using List.
--> How List is internally will work?
-->Can you write our own ArrayList?How it is ?
-->Can you write List snippet code how you have used in project?
Q.What is the day-to-day activities in your office?
• Our office official timings: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM
• We will reach office @ 9 or 9:30 AM.
• First will check the client emails .So we came to know that what work we need to do.
• Attending the scrum call or onshore status call @10:00 AM This will be around 10:00 AM to 10:30
AM
• I will get clarify if any doubts in call.
• Will go for tea break 10:15 AM to 10 :45 AM
• I will start project work and continue until 1 or 1:30 PM
• Will go for lunch 1 hour 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM
• Start work from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM .
• Tea break 15 mins
• Start work from 4:45 PM to 6 :30 PM or 7:00 PM
• Before leave office sent status mail to onshore team.
Q.Can you explain your project scenario?and write the snippet code?
Sol : In our project to build the response we are writing 2 methods with same name one is for to build
success response another one to build the failure response.
Public class ProdudctResponseBuilder{
public ProductServiceResp buildServiceResp(final ProductDaoResp
serviceResp) {
final ProductServiceResp resp = new ProductServiceResp();
//logic return resp;
}
public ProductServiceResp buildServiceResp (String respCode,String 
respMsg) {final ProductServiceResp resp = new ProductServiceResp();
//logic return resp.
}
}
Q.If already junit is there why you should use Mockito?
Sol:
• If our application will not have any backends then we can use only Junit is enough.So not required
mockito and powermockito.
• If our application needs to communicate with backend then using junit we cannot test all the
scenarios. So that Code coverage will be less.
• To improve the code coverage we should use Mockito
• If already Mockito is there why you should use PowerMockito?
Sol: Actually in our project we have used initially Mockito only.
• We have written some of the test cases using mockito to mock the external/back end systems.
• In some of the scenarios mockito is unable to mock an object because of this issue we are unable
to test the all the scenarios. We did Google to resolve these issue then we came to know that
PowerMockito can resolve these issue. So we have implemented powermockito in our project.
Q.What are the exceptions you have faced during project development? and deployment?
Sol:
During development we have faced exceptions like NullPointerException,
ClassNotFoundException,BeanInstanceCreationException,IllegalArgumentException.
During deployment we have faced exceptions like OutofMemory error,Heap dumps (temporary) file : These files will be created by remote os
day to day these files size will be increased. In dev server we will delete the heap dumps by login into
putty using dev server ipaddress, username,pwd
$temp>rm -rf *
More applications deployed in remote server:
The applications size more than remote server size then we will try delete the unused application by
getting permission from owner of the application
If the issue is still not resolved then raise the incident to network team they will be fix the issue.
Q. Is it possible to handle the exception without try and catch?
Sol: yes, we can do
@ExceptionHanlder will be configured in @ControllerAdvice class.
@ControllerAdvice
public class CardPaymentsControllerAdvice{
@ExceptionHandler(value= ServicReqInvalidException.class)
@ResponseBody
Public CardPaymentServiceResp handleReqInvalidException(ServicReqInvalidException exe){
//prepare the error response
}
}
Q.Can you write snippet code how to write custom exception?
Public class ReqInvalidException extends Exception { Private String errorCode;
Private String errorMsg;
Public ReqInvalidException (String errorCode,String errorMsg){
this.errorCode= errorCode;
this.errorMsg =errorMsg;
}
//getters
}
Exception VS RuntimeException :
Exception: It is checked exception, which are enabled at compile time Runtime Exception: It is unchecked
exception, which are enabled at runtime.
Note: either checked or unchecked exceptions will be raised at runtime only
Q.Can you explain how you have handled exceptions in your project and write the snippet code?
Sol: Generally to implement exceptions in our we should use custom exceptions or use defined
exceptions. According to client requirement
We have categorized custom exceptions into different kind of exceptions
RequestInvalidException
BusinessException
SystemException
UnknownErrorException
Q.What are the Linux commands you have used in your project?
Sol: To communicate with remote servers ( Dev or test or prod ) which are deployed on Linux servers
then we should use linux commands using putty.
ls
cd
pwd
chmod -Rf 7777 filename
rm -Rf 777 filename
tail -f catalina.out
./startup.sh
8 ./shutdown.sh
Clear
Cat filename
Q.How to deploy the application ?
• We have developed the code and commit the code into GIT.
• Build all the maven modules into Jenkins.
• Jenkins will checkout the code from GIT and generates jars, war and deploys the application into
dev and test environment based on configuration in Jenkins we will choose dev or test servers.Note: We will not deploy the application into production environment as we don’t have access for
prod servers
• For production deployment shares the Jenkins URL to release management team. They will follow
with network team to deploy the application into prod servers.
• Once deployment is done .Release Manager will inform to us. So that we will start the testing the application (validate the changes).
Q.How many environments for your projects?
Sol: 1. Dev (E1) 2. Test (E2 or UAT) 3. Production
Q.Q)How to identify the issue?
The production support team will raise an incident and assign to dev team.
Seviority:There are different types of seviorities like Sev1(P1), Sev2(P2), Sev3(P3)
Sev 1 --- Immediately Bridge opened . Everyone related to project will be joined and resolve the issue
within one hour.
Scenarios: Application is not working or not started db
Sev2 --
we should accept the IMR with in 15 mins Need to resolve the issue in 2 days and
Do the changes in local and moved to dev and test environments.If it is working fine then only move the
changes to production.
Scenario: Application is working but for sometimes success and for sometimes getting 500 errors Sev 3 IMR: Fix this issue. Move the changes to live in next 1 month
Q.What are the problems or risks you have faced in your project ?Can you explain them?
Sol :
Problem1 : Spring scopes prototype is override by singleton
In my project we have used spring ioc for instantiating the beans. Starting we have implemented xml file
configuration as per architect suggestion we have moved to java config. While migrating we have forgot
remove the entries in xml file.
<beans>
<context:component-scan basepackage="com.barclys"/>
<bean id="balancetask" class="BalanceTask"/>
<bean id="transactiontaks" class="TransactionTask"/>
</beans>
Java Config :
We have implemented parallel calls in my project, unfortunately we didn’t close the threads beacuse of
this issue in production servers will be down for every week, after more analysis we identify that issue
with thread are not closed properly.
Q)Can you explain how it works SSL?
Validate certificate 2. Establish the Secure Connection
3. Transactions will be in secure (encrypted format)
Application Level:
Authentication is is used validate the credentials and Authorized to access the particular resource or not
Authentication Steps :
→Using BASE64 algorithm username and pwd will be encoded and send this in request header as below
Authorization: Basic YTEEESWE#$%^&==
Q.6.How you have implemented security in your project?
Sol :
Case 1: Yes. We have implemented security in our project.
SSL
Application Level
But i didn’t get the chance to work on this. My senior developer has implemented this. I know the
theoretical process how the security work .
(OR)
Case 2: Yes. We have implemented security in our project.
SSL
Application Level
SSL: To implement this SSL we need JKS file and Password Client has provided these details.
We will share these details to network team; they will be configured JKS file at server level.
We will share public key to the entire consumer. They will be configuring at their appserver level. So that
for every interaction between client and server will be transferred in encryption form.
Q.5.What are the roles and responsibilities in your Project?
Sol:
For ❤ yrexp:
My Role is Developer and my responsibilities are involved in develop the web service using rest and
writing test cases using junit,mockito,powemockito and also involved in supporting to testing team to fix
the bugs.
For >= 3 yrs.
My Role is Sr.Developer and my responsibilities are understanding project requirement by attending
client calls from onshore, involved in develop the web service using rest and writing test cases using
junit,mockito,powemockito and also helping team if they will struck anywhere and involved in supporting to testing team to fix the bugs.
Q.Can you write the snippet code ?
@Test
Public void testCardNumber_Invalid_Scenario(){
---
Assert.assertEquals(--,--);
}
Q.23. What is polymorphism? Where have you used in the project?
Sol: Single task may perform many operations.
static (method overloading ) 2. dynamic ( method overriding )
In our project we have used method overloading, writing 2 or more methods in a class. The method name
isthe same but arguments are different.
Q.What is encapsulation?where you have used in project?
Sol : Encapsulation : Data hiding + Abstraction
Data hiding : By declaring all the member variables as private in a class .
Abstraction : Hide the implemenation details .
public class Account{
private int amount;
public void setAmount(String amount){ if( amount > 100 ){
this.amount = amount;
}
}
In our project, we have used to create the beans like DTO, VO. These beans we have applied Encapsulation.
Q.How do you perform the code coverage?
Sol: We have Cobertura and JACOCO plugins and Configure these plugins in pom.xml
And we ran mvn cobertura:cobertua command to get the cobertura report.
>mvn clean test // for JACOCO

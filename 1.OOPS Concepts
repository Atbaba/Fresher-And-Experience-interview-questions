by using private modified we can implement data hiding.

Abstraction in Java:

2. must abstract class as abstract keyword.
3.cannot possible to instantiate (Object creation is not possible)
4. we can allowed to write both abstract and concrete methods(concrete methods nothing but method with body).

Encapsulation=Data Hiding+Abstraction.

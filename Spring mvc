@RequestParam:
read the form data

Model: request data provided to the view page
m.addAttribute("hi"mes);

FrontController: FrontController is a design pattern.
DispatcherServlet is build in frontController. 
Controllers all activities.
implemented on MVC2 architecture.
one per web application.
acts as single entry or single exit.
it traps all requests applies common system services like logging,security delegate all requests to handlel classes 
takes results as Model passes to view components to browser

Spring MVC Flow:
Request-DS-HM-beanId to DS-DS get Handler object-DS calls Handler method-DS gets LVN+model data keeps in model attribute-
DS gives LVN to ViewResolver-ViewResolver gives View Object to DS-DS calls render()on View Object-PVC-DS-response to Browser.
 
ViewResolver:
logical view name 
prefix
suffix

Handler[Controller]:
The most common way to implement the handler in the Spring Web MVC application is as a controller.
Built-in controller types
The controller is an interface that has few implementation classes are there. 
1. AbstractCommandController[For form submission without validations],
2. SimpleFormController[For form submission with validations],
3. AbstractWizardFormController[To display and process form that is coming in chain and etc],
4. MultiActionController[To handle multiple hyperlinks/multiple submits button requests],
5. AbstractController[ For Hyberlinks], 
6. AbstractUrlViewController, 
7. ParameterizableViewController, 
8. ServletForwardingController, 
9. ServletWrappingController, 
10. UrlFilenameViewController.

HandlerMapping[controller methods]:
map incoming requests to URLs to the controller.
The HandlerMapping is an interface that has few implementation classes are there. 
1. SimpleUrlHandlerMapping[Best in XML driven spring MVC configuration],
2. BeanNameURLHandlerMapping[Default in XML driven configuration],
3. ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping,
4. DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping,
5. RequestMappingHandlerMapping[Best for annotation driven configuration and default from spring 5.x].

Interceptors:
pre/post logics like filters.

RequestMapping:
getmapping+postmappping

Double Posting Problem:
Duplicate Form Submission
Submitting post mode requests multiple times either by pressing the back button and submit or using the refresh button
example: payment gateway.

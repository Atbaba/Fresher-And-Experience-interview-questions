@RequestParam:
read the form data

Model: request data provided to the view page
m.addAttribute("hi"mes);

FrontController: FrontController is a design pattern.
DispatcherServlet is build in frontController. 
Controllers all activities.
implemented on MVC2 architecture.
one per web application.
acts as single entry or single exit.
it traps all requests applies common system services like logging,security delegate all requests to handlel classes 
takes results as Model passes to view components to browser

Spring MVC Flow:
Request-DS-HM-beanId to DS-DS get Handler object-DS calls Handler method-DS gets LVN+model data keeps in model attribute-
DS gives LVN to ViewResolver-ViewResolver gives View Object to DS-DS calls render()on View Object-PVC-DS-response to Browser.
 
ViewResolver:
logical view name 
prefix
suffix

HandlerMapping:
map incoming requests to urls to controller.
Interceptors:
pre/post logics like filters.

RequestMapping:
getmapping+postmappping

Double Posting Problem:
Duplicate Form Submission
Submitting post mode request for multiple times either by pressing back button and submit or using refresh button
example: payment gateway.

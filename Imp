Q.Why Strings are immutable in Java?
The strings are Immutable in Java as the String items are stored in the String pool. Since stored String literals appear to be shared among multiple users there is constantly a danger, where one user's action might affect all different users. For instance, if one user adjusts the estimation of String "Test" to "TEST", all different users will also recognize that as "TEST".

Since storing String items was necessary from administration reason this danger was circumvented by creating String class Changeless. At a similar time, String was declared final so that no one may yield invariant of String type like Immutability, hashcode calculation, Caching, etc by increasing and reversing functions.

Q.What is the use of hashcode in Java?
A hashcode is a number of a Java Object. This is something that enables objects to be collected or retrieved immediately in a Hashtable. hashCode() is utilized for bucketing in Hash executions like HashMap, HashSet, HashTable, etc. The amount collected from hashCode() is utilized as the container amount for collecting components of the map or set. This container quantity is the position of the component within the map or set.

The goal of the hashCode() program is to present a numeric description of an item's contents to present an alternate device to loosely classify it. The hashCode() yields an entity that describes the in-house concept location of the item.

Q. List some Immutable classes in Java?
An immutable state indicates that once an item is designed, we may not be able to alter its element. Seldom it is important to create an immutable set as per the terms. ImmutableList, as implied by the title, is a kind of List that is changeless. It indicates that the content of the Program is established or unswerving after the declaration, which means, these are read-only. If any effort made to compute, delete and refresh components in the List, UnsupportedOperationException is discharged.

For instance, Character, Double, Boolean, Byte, Float, Long, Short, String, Integer and all fundamental wrapper groups are immutable classes.

Q.Why do we use streams in Java?
Included in Java 8, the Stream API is utilized to concoct collections of items. A stream is a series of items that support various processes which may be pipelined to create the desired effect.

The specialties of Java stream imply –

A stream is a non-data structure rather it necessitates data from the Arrays, Collections, or I/O carriers.
Streams don’t alter the original information arrangement; they only present the outcome as per the pipelined plans.
Each common operation is gradually completed and delivers a stream as a consequence, hence multiple intermediate signs of progress may be pipelined. Terminal processes mark the conclusion of the current and deliver the outcome.

Q. Tell me some difference between String builder and String buffer?
Differences between String builder and String buffer in Java

StringBuffer is synchronized that is, thread-safe. It indicates that two threads may not describe the practices of StringBuffer concurrently. Whereas StringBuilder is non-synchronized which means that it is not thread-safe. It indicates that two threads may describe the processes of StringBuilder concurrently.
Again, StringBuffer is less effective than StringBuilder. Whereas StringBuilder is more effective than StringBuffer.
StringBuffer had been the single option for String administration till Java 1.4 but it produces one problem that each of its common methods is synchronized. Thus, StringBuffer produces Thread safety but on production value.
Mostly, we do not apply String in a multithreaded situation, so Java 1.5 launched a distinct type StringBuilder that is alike to StringBuffer except for synchronization and thread-safety.

Q. Is Java supports multiple inheritance?
When one class extends for more than one class, then it is known as multiple inheritance.

No, Java does not support multiple inheritance to prevent the ambiguity that it can cause. The diamond problem is one such problem that can exist in multiple inheritance. The problem persists when the methods exist in both the sub and superclasses. Multiple inheritance can cause different problems like constructor chaining and cast in Java.

Q.Different between List and set.
List can be defined as the type of ordered collection that regulates the elements in the insertion order. It also allows duplicate elements. Inside the List interface, new methods are introduced. Listiterator can insert a List in both forward and backward directions. The list is implemented to store objects that are non-unique according to the instruction order.

Set can be defined as a type of unordered collection in which elements do not maintain any order. All the elements inside a Set are unique. The set interface does not introduce any new interface. Only collection interface methods can be implemented in the Set subclasses. The set can be inserted only in the forward direction with the assistance of an iterator.

Q.Explain difference between put and post?
PUT inserts a resource or a file at the specified URI. If there is already a resource or file at the specific URI, it is then replaced by PUT. PUT is idempotent, but the responses of PUT are non-cacheable. The URI inside a PUT finds out the entity that is enclosed within a request.

A specific set of data is sent to the URI by POST. The resource present at that URI handles the request. The web server next determines what to do with the data in the specified resource. The POST is non-idempotent. The responses of the POST are cacheable as the server determines the ideal Expire Headers and Cache-control.

Q.How java removes unused objects from Memory?

The Java runtime environment has a trash collector that regularly clears the Memory managed by items that are not largely referenced. The trash compiler does its work automatically, although, in many situations, you can need to explicitly demand trash collection by requesting the GC process in the System type.

You may eliminate an item in Java by excluding the reference to it by allowing null. Following that, it will incline to be automatically removed by the Garbage Collector. You introduced it to void. However, Java does not provide you the opportunity to deallocate retention.

Q.What is the difference between RequestMapping and GetMapping in Spring Boot?
Both @GetMapping and @RequestMapping are annotations for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods in Spring boot. @GetMapping is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping. @GetMapping is the newer annotation

Q.What is the use of @SpringBootApplication annotation?
@SpringBootApplication annotation was introduced in Spring Boot version 1.2.0. It is a convenience annotation which is used in spring boot application to enable additions of beans using the classpath definitions

Q.How Might You Implement Spring Security In Spring Boot Application?
Usage of spring security in Spring boot application requires quite a little configuration. You have to include spring-boot-starter-security starter in pom.xml. You need to make spring config class, which will expand WebSecurity Configure Adapter and override expected strategy to accomplish security in Spring boot application.

Q.How do you configure error logging/debugging in Spring boot application?
You can configure error logging/debugging in Spring boot application by applying the following settings in application.properties or application.yml file.

logging.level.org.springframework.web: DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate: ERROR

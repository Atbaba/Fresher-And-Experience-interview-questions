1. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SELF :
Hi, This is Prarik, I completed MCA in August 2016 and, I have 3.2 years of experience on java 
j2ee technology, a part from my experience I involved in three projects. Some of the projects are 
belongs to Banking Domain (BFS) and some are belongs to Health Care Domain. In all these 
projects I used technology like-Java J2ee, spring, web services, Hibernate, Design Pattern, Tools 
(JUnit, Maven, SVN, Log4j, WinScp and Putty etc) and etc.
Presently, I am working on NCAP (HealthCare Domain). 
2. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CURRENT PROJECTS:
National Cardiac Audit Programme (NCAP) is the national health project to manage 
Hospitals,Patients and audit across UK.
This project is very high volume data, every hospital will provide and option to manage their patient 
details and audits of the patients respectively. Hospitals have an option to export and import data as 
well. The services are divided into three different modules,
1. Registration 2. Patient (Spine) 3. Import and Export 4. Audit
 1. Patient: It is the rest service for manage patients. In this project api’s are provided for create, 
edit and search patients.
 2. Registration: Hospitals will register with NHS Application. Hospitals can enter their the 
required details.If these details are validated then NHS Application will stored these details into DB
And also generate generate the credentials.Send these credentials to hosiptals emails.
3. Import and Export : Hospitals can insert the data using in single record or import as bulk 
details and also get list of patient details on page or can export in the form of PDF or excel or text.
4. Audit: NCAP is the project developed for managing audits (procedures). In this hospital user can 
enter the details of the procedure. The details entered are validated based on the rules defined for a 
procedure. If there are not serious error particular audit details are exported to analysis system.

3. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PROJECT ARCHITECTURE:
HTTP NHS System.
Hospital-1
HTTP
Hospital -2 Project Architecture (Provider Side).
WST
 req req
 resp resp
S.L P.L I.L
SOR
WEB-
SERVICE

A part of my project architecture, I am working as provider side. In this provider side having 
three layer
A). Service Layer.
B). Process Layer.
C). Integration Layer.
Here our NHS interacted with the SOR(DataBase) system.
 Here with respect to the project architecture, Hospitals will send the HTTPs request, by 
this request going to the provider side (a) Service Layer (b) Process Layer (c)
Integration Layer, in this service layer we are validating the data and calling the process 
layer & send it to the process layer, by this data we perform the converting point logic.
4. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PROJECT TECHNICAL FLOW:
A part of my project technical flow, here first we are taking the business requirement 
from the client and by this business requirement we prepare the Data Mapping Sheet, 
and we prepare the Schema file, and by using this XSD file we generate the WSDL, and 
then create the Artifacts (creating the .java and .classes file).
And by the artifacts create Service layer implementation class, in this class calling the 
interface of whatever generated by the WSDL file.
Here is the Technical Flow of my project (Partner Integration).

6. How you are handling exception in your project?
As part of my project we are handling the exception, generally in my project we have 
handle user defined exception, based on the business requirement we have categorized 
user defined exception into different types of exception like-
A). Business Exception.
B). System Exception.
C). Service Exception.
Here, when the user sends the request element (like- fistName, LastName, D.O.B, MobNo 
and etc.) data, if that data is not valid then we are throwing the some user defined 
exception. This data not sending to the process layer, here only we are handle the 
exception.
a) Business Exception :- Here business exception means if the User sending the request 
element , that request element is not valid then that time we handle the business 
exception. To handle this, here we are writing the some user defined exception class
and some Enum class/properties files/XML files. By this class we handle the 
business exception. In business exception coming the some DataException this one also related to the request data only.

b) System Exception: - This Exception coming at the time of running the service, this 
one also related to the hardware system, this exception will be handling by the
Admin team. This exception we handle in Throw able class exception. 
c) Service Exception: - In service exception we handle the service related exception 
like- DBConnection error.
In my project having layers like- service layer, process layer, Integration layer.
In Integration layer, as per business requirement we are categorized different kind of 
user defined exceptions.
Some exception we are throwing, the exception in process layer and service layer.
Here, I am explaining the some exceptions.
NumberFormateException, ClassCastException, ClassNotFoundException, 
FileNotFoundException, NullPointerException and etc.
NullPointerException :- To resolve the NullPointerException before creating the object 
we can write some if_else (for avoiding this exception) statement and checkout this, and 
make sure that object not null, if object whatever you pass is null then that time you will 
get NullPointerException.
ClassNotFoundException :- At the time of loading the class if that class is not available 
then that you will get the ClassNotFoundException.
To resolve this Exception you make sure whatever you load the class, that class is 
available. Another style of handle this exception is you should pass the class otherwise 
you will get this exception. 
7. What are the exceptions you have used in project during deployment?
A part of our project we are facing the different type of exception like,
A). OutOfMemoryException.
B). ResourcesFailedException.
C). NullPointerException, and etc.
A). OutOfMemoryException : - To handle this exception, we raise request/ticket to 
support/admin team. They will resolve issue and update the ticket, in stage server we 
handled or resolve this issue.
Here have some reasons.
(1). Heap Dumps.
(2). More no. of application.
B). ResourceFailedException: -
8. What is Encapsulation?Where you have used in project?
Encapsulation is the ability to package data. It is all about packaging related stuff 
together and hides them from external elements. Encapsulation importance here is for binding data and methods together.

Binding all these data and behaviour in a single class we are following the encapsulation 
principle.
In my project we are using the encapsulation concept, in my project structure we are 
writing the encapsulation concept in the valueBean class, here we are bind the all useful 
data and methods together to provide the services.
The process of Data hiding is called encapsulation; we can achieve this by declaring 
property as ‘private’.
So that no one can access this property from outside the class, but they can access this 
property by using public method (setter/getter).
As part of my project, we are developed all the beans, it behave as encapsulation. 
Generally beans will have private properties and setter and getter, so that we are hiding 
the data through ‘private’ modifier.
Ex :
 Public class RequestValueBean{
 Private String patientId;
 Private String name;
 Private String addr;
 ...................
// setter and getter.
9. What is polymorphism?Where you have used in project?
The concept of polymorphism is to provide the multiple actions. Single task can perform 
multiple operations is called polymorphism.
Polymorphism means making a bunch of abstract and regular classes.
For example we are create own object structure. Make different objects extends each 
other. And then write the same methods over again using different parameters and 
putting them in the parent class and subclass then test these objects by writing a main 
class.
The best example of polymorphism is, in our project we have implemented, build the 
response. If it is success we are calling one method buildResponse(obj.).
If it is failure we will call same buildResponse(String respCode, String respMsg). But 
method parameter must be different.
EX :
public class RegSvcRequestBuilder{
 public respType buildResponse(reqType reqtype){
private String pid;
 private String pname;
 private String address;
//setter and getter.
}
}

 guide to them hot to write junit test cases for some part of the code.
11 Q) What are the problems/risks you have faced in project ?
Sol : we have faced many problems ,some of them are 
 1. Special character issue :
 In our project we will send then response data in the form of json. One of the 
element value is getting special character in production,where as dev and test 
environment it is not getting. As a provider i am send as it is response to 
consumer.Consumer end unable to perform deserializae at their end.i.e. unable convert 
json to java object.
2. DB Issue : DB team while move the data from test to prod they did misake one of the 
db element is configured is wrong.
 So in production always we are getting SQLInvalidGrammerError.
 DB team has fix the issue 
For this issue PSG(Production Support Group) team has raised the Sev-2 IMR. We have 
resolved the issue with the help of DB team.
 Note : IMR -- Incident Management Request Sev – Seviority
Sev-1 : very high priority Sev-2 : High Sev-3 : medium Sev- 4 : Low
 3. Certificate Issues : Provider production certificates got expired
 In dev and test it was working fine.We assume that it will work on production also,but 
after 2 days of prod deployment then we are getting "SSLHnadShakeException"--
Certificate Expired.
We have informed to provider and get the renewal certificate from
provider team and moved our changes in prod .

11. What is singleton design pattern where you use this in your project?
Singleton design pattern is the most popular and the older design pattern within the 
design pattern catalog. If we create a class as a singleton, an Application allows only one 
instance of that class. Generally we create a class as singleton when we want global 
point of access to that instance.
Create single instance/object for class within the JVM(multiple request).
Generally singleton design pattern are used for logging implementation DAO Utility.
=>As part of our project, we are implementing this for passing error details (i.e-
maintaining errorCodes/errorMessages) in XML file.
=> We have written DOM parser as a singleton design pattern to read the error info in 
XML.
EX:-
errorCodes.xml
<errorDetails>
 <errors>
 <error>
 <errorCode>FF001</errorCode>
 <errorMessage>clientIdInvalid</errorMessage>
 </error>
 <error>
 <errorCode>FF002</errorCode>
 <errorMessage>clientIdInvalid</errorMessage>
 </error>
 </errors>
How to implement singleton design pattern:
1). Declare the constructor of the class as private-When we declare the constructor 
of the class as private, other classes in the application cannot create the object of the 
class directly (Stops allowing more instances).
2). Declare a static method As we made the constructor of the class as private, no 
one from outside the class can call the constructor to create the object. The methods of 
the same class can call the constructor to create objects, so in this method we can write 
the code check and return only one object of the class.
But if this method is a member method, to call it we need an object of the class (which is 
not possible). So to call this method without the object, declare this method as static 
method.
As this method contains only the logic for creating the object, this method is also called 
as factory method as static method.
3). Declare a static member of the same class type in the class in the static 
method, we need to write the code for returning only one instance of the class.
Q. How do we track an object for that class already exists?
=> That’s where when we create a first object we will assign it to a member variable. So, 
in the next call to the method, you just return the same object which you stored in the 
member variable. But member variables cannot be used in a static method, so we need 
to declare that variable as static variable to hold the reference of the same class.
Types of implementation. 
1). Eager Initialization.
2). Static block Initialization.

3). Lazy Initialization.
4). Override clone method and throw CloneNotSupportedException.
5). Thread Synchronized.
6). Thread block level Synchronized.
7). Bill paug implementation.
